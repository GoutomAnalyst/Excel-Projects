# Excel-Projects

This is a call centre performing dynamic dashboard!

I have used different excel concepts in this project, such as
▶ Designing the dashboard color theme and fonts
▶ How to use Data model feature of Excel to connect datasets
▶ Creating KPIs and measures using Power Pivot and DAX
▶ Using Pivot tables to create all the dashboard calculations
▶ Making interactive Pivot Charts with slicers
▶ Applying conditional formatting to charts & tables
▶ Using XLOOKUP and images in Excel to show dynamic pictures
